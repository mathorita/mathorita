## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Matheus Toshiaki Horita**, a Brazilian developer currently based in Japan.  
At 29 years old, I'm fully committed to transitioning into tech — focused on back-end development with **Python**.

I studied Computer Science at UEL (Brazil) and got 3 years of hands-on work experience in Japan, working 12-hour shifts in a factory without ever being late. That discipline is now fueling my new mission: building a remote tech career so I can support my family financially back in Brazil.

## 🔧 What I'm Doing Now

- 📌 Studying back-end development full time (5–8 hours daily)
- 🐍 Learning Python and Django REST Framework
- 💻 Building real-world API projects and solving programming challenges
- 🌍 Preparing for remote job opportunities in strong currency markets

## 📚 Skills in Progress

- Python 3 (core syntax, OOP, exceptions)
- Django + Django REST Framework
- Postman & API testing
- Git & GitHub workflow
- Automated tests with pytest

## 🧪 Projects

Here are a few things I'm building and improving:

- ✅ [PicPay Backend Challenge](https://github.com/mathorita/picpay-desafio-backend): Full money transfer simulation with validation, external API integration and test coverage
- ✅ [Olist Challenge](https://github.com/mathorita/Olist-Challenge): API for managing authors and books with filters and serializers
- ✅ [School API](https://github.com/mathorita/School-API): CRUD API for students, courses, and enrollments with validation and nested serializers
- 🛑 [Zé Delivery Challenge](https://github.com/mathorita): (Paused) Attempted a delivery area geo-filter API, but my current PC couldn't handle GDAL required for spatial queries
